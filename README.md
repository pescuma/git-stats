git-stats
=========

Stats for your git repository


### Running

Add to path and call `git stats` inside a git repository (`git-stats` also work). No command line options are needed. If you want you can pass the path to the repository as an argument and also `-t X` to set the number of threads to run (by default it's number of cores - 1).

It will run `git blame` over all the files in the repository and show some nice grouped information.
